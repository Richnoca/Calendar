# CS399 learning recap

Well I definitely learned a lot about Python this quarter. Plenty of Youtube videos as well as reading over other repositiories that I was able to learn how certain features are able to be implemented. One of the great helps this quarter was also Copilot in VSCode, when I would get stuck Copilot would often give me a prompting on what I was trying to do to help push me in the right direction (sometimes, not always useful but it did help out quite a bit).

New Skill: One thing I challenged myself for this quarter project is being able to learn how to do design and layout of the GUI, though I still am not happy with how it looks right now (I'm not sure I ever will be, I think that's just a feature of design sometimes) I'm happy that I was able to learn about effectively designing a widget with buttons and interfaces. Making the Calendar interactive was a neat little challenge and I'm glad I was able to figure that out through a bit of trial and error. The Self Evaluation scroll box definitely gave me the most trouble, but since I'm not happy with how pretty it is I do look forward to spending more time on it in my free non-school time to tinker with it.

Technical Challenges: I thought I knew about web scraping and that it was simple, which it wasn't too hard but when you get into the world of user data that is private it isn't as simple as one of my past projects where I could scrape publicly available information. As you know I was stuck for quite a while just getting my runs to populate into my calendar until I decided to switch from Strava API application to Garmin Connect login. I was able to implement this with help from github repository (https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect/blob/master/README.md). ***BUT*** This actually turned out to be a blessing because I was able to accomplish one of my goals that I didn't think I would be able to, that being an app that anyone has the ability to use. With implementing a login .json file anybody can utilize this Calendar app, instead of having to authorize through strava every time you want to try and use it (Still not sure how I was goign to pull that off).

Scope & Timeline: I think I did well with the overall scope and abillity to keep up with timelines. I did notice that I hadn't ever really reflected back on my initial timelin that I submitted at the start of the quarter to make sure I was keeping myself in check on implementations and when I think they should be done by. So that would be a down check, my process for a lot of the project was "I think it should have this feature so let's figure out how to implement it" and that process happened every time I worked on it. So maybe I should have taken more time to plan out the eveeryting and think of all the features before starting rather than implementing new tools/features as I go.

Bad Habit: aside from the aforementioned planning process that I don't think I helped myself in throughout the project, I think one thing that caused me headache and errors in this project is over reliance sometimes on Copilot. When you're typing out code and Copilot gives you prompts to implement because it thinks it fits your code, sometimes it's easy to just accept that input and you get "accept input happy" and takes away from ***your*** project I think. Next quarter in CS399 I want to write the next project idea in another IDE such as Mu Editor from Python class so I don't feel tempted to use Copilot too much. It did help me out a few times when I was stuck, but there was also a few times where it got me stuck or even implemented something that I wasn't trying to do. So then I would have to go back and make changes and that just creates extra work in the end. So overall, improvements would be better project planning, maybe I can sit down with a pen and paper for a few days and plan everything out. As well as over reliance on external tools, they can be useful but they also hinder learning process and don't force you to research how to over come problems you encounter.
